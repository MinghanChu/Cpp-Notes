# C++ this pointer

### Introduction

1. **"this"** key word is only accessible through a **member function.** A member function means a function that belongs to a **class.**

2. **"this"** is a **pointer** to the current object instance that the method belongs to.
3. In c++ we can **instantiate an object** and then call the **non-static method**. 

4. The non-static method can be called with **valid object** and "**this**" is the **pointer to that object.**
