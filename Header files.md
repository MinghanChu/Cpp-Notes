# C++ Header files

### Introduction

1. **Header files** are traditionally used to declare certain types of functions.
2. If we create one function in one file and we want to use it in another file, header files come into play, giving declarations when compiling.
3. Just **declarations**, no actual definitions! Remember only define a function once!
